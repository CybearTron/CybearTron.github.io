<h2>I am a Software Developer (learning) and a Student.I have made the word "HWLO" WHICH THE NEW WAY OF SAYING HELLO!!! I am a teen that is damn Interested in Computers and Programming!!!<br>
<br>
When The Pandemic was going on I decided I will start Coding!!! I was at first wanting to do Gamedev but soon got to understand that I dont like Gamdev as much as I do to software dev. Since then I started learning Python!!!! I know some java too!!!<br>
<br>
I have made a few python projects which u can see on <a href="https://github.com/CybearTron"> my Github Profile!!</a><br><br>
  
  I have made this using https://monasoft.itch.io/text-to-html by Monasoft and I have used Kale's Colour Palette that he gave me and if u wanna check him out : <a href="https://kaleandpearl.wixsite.com/knpdev"> His site </a>
